# Data_Exploration_Using_COVID_data_-_SQL

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to daily life, with millions of people affected by the disease and countless more impacted by the economic and social consequences of the crisis. As a result, there has been a great deal of interest in understanding the spread of the virus, the impact of public health measures, and the effectiveness of different strategies for mitigating the pandemic's impact.

One way to gain insight into these questions is through data analysis, and in particular, the use of SQL to explore and analyze COVID-19 data. In this project I have  used SQL queries to extract and analyze data from COVID-19 dataset.The data includes daily case counts, deaths, and vaccination rates for different countries and regions.

The project is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the data. Some of the key insights obtained from this analysis include the countries with the highest COVID-19 case counts, the relationship between vaccination rates and case counts, and the impact of various factors such as age and gender on the severity of the disease.
